        MRS. ELVSTED.

        Thanks, not for me.


        BERTA.

        Oh, very well. [She goes softly out by the hall door.


        HEDDA.

        [Is wakened by the shutting of the door, and looks up.] What's that--?


        MRS. ELVSTED.

        It was only the servant.


        HEDDA.

        [Looking about her.] Oh, we're here--! Yes, now I remember. [Sits erect
        upon the sofa, stretches herself, and rubs her eyes.] What o'clock is
        it, Thea?


        MRS. ELVSTED.

        [Looks at her watch.] It's past seven.


        HEDDA.

        When did Tesman come home?


        MRS. ELVSTED.

        He has not come.
