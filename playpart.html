        <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
        <p>Thanks, not for me.</p>

        <h3>BERTA.</h3>
        <p>Oh, very well.</p><p>[She goes softly out by the hall door.</p>

        <h3>HEDDA.</h3>
        <p>[Is wakened by the shutting of the door, and looks up.]</p><p>What's that--?</p>

        <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
        <p>It was only the servant.</p>

        <h3>HEDDA.</h3>
        <p>[Looking about her.]</p><p>Oh, we're here--! Yes, now I remember.</p><p>[Sits erect upon the sofa, stretches herself, and rubs her eyes.]</p><p>What o'clock is it, Thea?</p>

        <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
        <p>[Looks at her watch.]</p><p> It's past seven.</p>

        <h3>HEDDA.</h3>
        <p>When did Tesman come home?</p>

        <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
        <p>He has not come.</p>
